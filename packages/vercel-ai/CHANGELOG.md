  Fixed compatibility issues between different zod versions that were causing TypeScript compilation errors. This issue occurs when multiple packages use different patch versions of zod (e.g., 3.23.x vs 3.24.x), leading to type instantiation depth problems. By pinning to 3.24.2, we ensure consistent behavior across all packages.

  Updated documentation examples (READMEs, docs, blogs) and relevant package code examples to use the `instructions` field instead of `description` when defining `Agent` instances.

  This change aligns the examples with the preferred API usage for the `Agent` class, where `instructions` provides behavioral guidance to the agent/LLM. This prepares for the eventual deprecation of the `description` field specifically for `Agent` class definitions.

  **Example Change for Agent Definition:**

  ```diff
    const agent = new Agent({
      name: "My Assistant",
  -   description: "A helpful assistant.",
  +   instructions: "A helpful assistant.",
      llm: new VercelAIProvider(),
      model: openai("gpt-4o-mini"),
    });
  ```

  - The API (`/text`, `/stream`, `/object`, `/stream-object` endpoints) now strictly expects the `content` field within message objects (when `input` is an array) to be either a `string` or an `Array` of content parts (e.g., `[{ type: 'text', text: '...' }]`).
  - The previous behavior of allowing a single content object (e.g., `{ type: 'text', ... }`) directly as the value for `content` in message arrays is no longer supported in the API schema. Raw string inputs remain unchanged.
  - Provider logic (`google-ai`, `groq-ai`, `xsai`) updated to align with this stricter definition.

  **Console:**

  - **Added file and image upload functionality to the Assistant Chat.** Users can now attach multiple files/images via a button, preview attachments, and send them along with text messages.
  - Improved the Assistant Chat resizing: Replaced size toggle buttons with a draggable handle (top-left corner).
  - Chat window dimensions are now saved to local storage and restored on reload.

  **Internal:**

  - Added comprehensive test suites for Groq and XsAI providers.

### Patch Changes

- [#71](https://github.com/VoltAgent/voltagent/pull/71) [`1f20509`](https://github.com/VoltAgent/voltagent/commit/1f20509528fc2cb2ba00f86d649848afae34af04) Thanks [@omeraplak](https://github.com/omeraplak)! - feat: Standardize Agent Error and Finish Handling

  This change introduces a more robust and consistent way errors and successful finishes are handled across the `@voltagent/core` Agent and LLM provider implementations (like `@voltagent/vercel-ai`).

  **Key Improvements:**

  - **Standardized Errors (`VoltAgentError`):**

    - Introduced `VoltAgentError`, `ToolErrorInfo`, and `StreamOnErrorCallback` types in `@voltagent/core`.
    - LLM Providers (e.g., Vercel) now wrap underlying SDK/API errors into a structured `VoltAgentError` before passing them to `onError` callbacks or throwing them.
    - Agent methods (`generateText`, `streamText`, `generateObject`, `streamObject`) now consistently handle `VoltAgentError`, enabling richer context (stage, code, tool details) in history events and logs.

  - **Standardized Stream Finish Results:**

    - Introduced `StreamTextFinishResult`, `StreamTextOnFinishCallback`, `StreamObjectFinishResult`, and `StreamObjectOnFinishCallback` types in `@voltagent/core`.
    - LLM Providers (e.g., Vercel) now construct these standardized result objects upon successful stream completion.
    - Agent streaming methods (`streamText`, `streamObject`) now receive these standardized results in their `onFinish` handlers, ensuring consistent access to final output (`text` or `object`), `usage`, `finishReason`, etc., for history, events, and hooks.

  - **Updated Interfaces:** The `LLMProvider` interface and related options types (`StreamTextOptions`, `StreamObjectOptions`) have been updated to reflect these new standardized callback types and error-throwing expectations.

  These changes lead to more predictable behavior, improved debugging capabilities through structured errors, and a more consistent experience when working with different LLM providers.

- ðŸš€ **Introducing VoltAgent: TypeScript AI Agent Framework!**

  This initial release marks the beginning of VoltAgent, a powerful toolkit crafted for the JavaScript developer community. We saw the challenges: the complexity of building AI from scratch, the limitations of No-Code tools, and the lack of first-class AI tooling specifically for JS.

  ![VoltAgent Demo](https://cdn.voltagent.dev/readme/demo.gif)
  VoltAgent aims to fix that by providing the building blocks you need:

  - **`@voltagent/core`**: The foundational engine for agent capabilities.
  - **`@voltagent/voice`**: Easily add voice interaction.
  - **`@voltagent/vercel-ai`**: Seamless integration with [Vercel AI SDK](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs/introduction).
  - **`@voltagent/xsai`**: A Seamless integration with [xsAI](https://xsai.js.org/).
  - **`@voltagent/cli` & `create-voltagent-app`**: Quick start tools to get you building _fast_.

  We're combining the flexibility of code with the clarity of visual tools (like our **currently live [VoltOps LLM Observability Platform](https://console.voltagent.dev/)**) to make AI development easier, clearer, and more powerful. Join us as we build the future of AI in JavaScript!
