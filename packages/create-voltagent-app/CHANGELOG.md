  Fixed compatibility issues between different zod versions that were causing TypeScript compilation errors. This issue occurs when multiple packages use different patch versions of zod (e.g., 3.23.x vs 3.24.x), leading to type instantiation depth problems. By pinning to 3.24.2, we ensure consistent behavior across all packages.

## 0.1.18

### Patch Changes

- [#102](https://github.com/VoltAgent/voltagent/pull/102) [`cdfec65`](https://github.com/VoltAgent/voltagent/commit/cdfec657f731fdc1b6d0c307376e3299813f55d3) Thanks [@omeraplak](https://github.com/omeraplak)! - refactor: use 'instructions' field for Agent definitions in examples - #88

  Updated documentation examples (READMEs, docs, blogs) and relevant package code examples to use the `instructions` field instead of `description` when defining `Agent` instances.

  This change aligns the examples with the preferred API usage for the `Agent` class, where `instructions` provides behavioral guidance to the agent/LLM. This prepares for the eventual deprecation of the `description` field specifically for `Agent` class definitions.

  **Example Change for Agent Definition:**

  ```diff
    const agent = new Agent({
      name: "My Assistant",
  -   description: "A helpful assistant.",
  +   instructions: "A helpful assistant.",
      llm: new VercelAIProvider(),
      model: openai("gpt-4o-mini"),
    });
  ```
