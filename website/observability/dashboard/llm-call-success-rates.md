The success rates chart shows your LLM agent call performance and success rates over your selected time period. Both call volume and reliability can be tracked in one view.

- **Green Bars**: Represent the number of successful calls per time interval
- **Red Dots**: Represent any error calls (though they may not always be visible if error rate is low)
- **White Line**: Tracks your success rate percentage over time
- **Dual Y-axis**: Left axis represents call counts, right axis represents success rate percentage

### Reading the Data

The graph is laid out to easily spot patterns:

- **Call Volume**: Bar heights show how busy your system was at different times
- **Success Trends**: White line shows if your success rate is steady or changing
- **Time Patterns**: See when your system is busiest and how regular it is during peak times
- **Problem Spots**: Dips in success rate line or red error markers help you spot issues

### Key Benefits

LLM Call Success Rates chart helps you:

- **Track performance trends**: See if your success rates are improving or declining over time
- **Identify problem periods**: Spot exactly when issues occurred and correlate with system events
- **Monitor call patterns**: Understand when your LLM gets used most
- **Verify improvements**: Check if optimizations and fixes are actually working
- **Debug issues**: Use timeline data to investigate specific incidents
- **Keep the plan up to date**: Schedule updates during periods of inactivity
