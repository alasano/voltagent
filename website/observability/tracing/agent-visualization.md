title: Agent Flow Charts
---

VoltOps transforms your AI agent workflows into interactive visual flowcharts, making complex multi-agent systems easy to understand and debug. Our node-based visualization shows how agents, tools, and data flow through your AI applications in real-time.

## Visual Flow Representation

Each trace is automatically rendered as an interactive graph where agents appear as connected nodes, showing the complete execution path from user input to final response. You can see exactly how agents delegate tasks, which tools they use, and how data flows between different components.

## Key Features

- **Interactive Node Graph**: Click on any agent or tool to inspect its inputs, outputs, and performance metrics
- **Real-time Updates**: Watch your AI workflows execute live as nodes light up and connections form
- **Hierarchical Views**: Zoom into sub-agents and see nested workflows with clear parent-child relationships
- **Timeline Integration**: Correlate the visual flow with precise timing information to identify bottlenecks

This n8n-style observability interface makes debugging AI agent interactions intuitive, helping you quickly identify issues in complex reasoning chains and optimize your agent orchestration.
