    advice: [
      "<strong>1. Get a Strong Foundation:</strong> Focus on understanding what LLMs are, basic prompt engineering, and the core problem orchestration solves.",
      "<strong>2. Key Component Deep Dive:</strong> Use the 'Explore Orchestration Components' widget above to understand Chains, Agents, Tools, Memory, and RAG individually.",
      "<strong>3. Read Introductory Articles:</strong> Look for beginner-friendly blog posts or documentation that explain orchestration concepts with simple examples.",

    advice: [
      "<strong>1. Start with a Clear, Small Problem:</strong> Don't try to boil the ocean. Pick a very specific task you want to automate or improve.",
      "<strong>2. Choose a Beginner-Friendly Framework:</strong> Consider frameworks known for good documentation and examples (your article mentions VoltAgent as a good starting point for its observability).",
      "<strong>3. Build a Simple Chain First:</strong> Try connecting 2-3 steps. For example, get user input -> process with LLM -> format LLM output.",
      "<strong>4. Incrementally Add Tools/Memory:</strong> Once your basic chain works, try adding a simple tool (like a calculator or a web search if the framework supports it easily) or a basic conversation memory.",

    advice: [
      "<strong>1. Understand the RAG Flow:</strong> Use the 'Interactive RAG Flow' widget to get a clear picture of all the steps involved.",
      "<strong>2. Prepare Your Data:</strong> Start with a small set of clean documents (e.g., a few text files or PDFs).",
      "<strong>3. Focus on Data Loading & Chunking:</strong> How will you get your data into the system and how will you split it effectively?",
      "<strong>4. Experiment with Embedding Models & Vector Stores:</strong> Different models and databases have different characteristics. If your framework allows, try simple options first.",
      "<strong>5. Test Retrieval:</strong> Before even involving the LLM for generation, check if your system retrieves relevant chunks for sample queries.",

  {
    id: "advanced_agents",
    label: "I want to explore more advanced agentic behaviors.",
    advice: [
      "<strong>1. Master Simple Agents First:</strong> Ensure you understand how a single agent uses tools and makes decisions before trying multi-agent setups.",
      "<strong>2. Study the ReAct Pattern:</strong> Understand how agents use a Reason + Act loop to accomplish tasks.",
      "<strong>3. Design Your Tools Carefully:</strong> Think about what specific capabilities your agent needs and how to make those tools reliable.",
      "<strong>4. Implement Robust Error Handling:</strong> Agents interacting with multiple tools and making many decisions are prone to more failure points.",
      "<strong>5. Focus on Observability:</strong> For complex agents, being able to trace their decisions and tool usage (like with the VoltOps LLM Observability Platform) is critical for debugging.",
