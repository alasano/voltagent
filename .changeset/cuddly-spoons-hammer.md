feat: add fullStream support and subagent event forwarding

Added `fullStream` support to the core agent system for enhanced streaming with detailed chunk types (text-delta, tool-call, tool-result, reasoning, finish, error). Also improved event forwarding between subagents for better multi-agent workflows. SubAgent events are now fully forwarded to parent agents, with filtering moved to the client side for better flexibility.

Real-world example:

```typescript
const response = await agent.streamText("What's the weather in Istanbul?");

if (response.fullStream) {
  for await (const chunk of response.fullStream) {
    // Filter out SubAgent text, reasoning, and source events for cleaner UI
    if (chunk.subAgentId && chunk.subAgentName) {
      if (chunk.type === "text" || chunk.type === "reasoning" || chunk.type === "source") {
        continue; // Skip these events from sub-agents
      }
    }

    switch (chunk.type) {
      case "text-delta":
        process.stdout.write(chunk.textDelta); // Stream text in real-time
        break;
      case "tool-call":
        console.log(`ðŸ”§ Using tool: ${chunk.toolName}`);
        break;
      case "tool-result":
        console.log(`âœ… Tool completed: ${chunk.toolName}`);
        break;
      case "reasoning":
        console.log(`ðŸ¤” AI thinking: ${chunk.reasoning}`);
        break;
      case "finish":
        console.log(`\nâœ¨ Done! Tokens used: ${chunk.usage?.totalTokens}`);
        break;
    }
  }
}
```
